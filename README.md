NiimPrintX is a Python library designed to seamlessly interface with NiimBot label printers via Bluetooth. 
It provides both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to design and print labels efficiently.

## Key Features
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** NiimPrintX works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring broad usability.
* **Bluetooth Connectivity:** Effortlessly connect to your NiimBot label printers via Bluetooth.
* **Comprehensive Model Support:** Compatible with multiple NiimBot printer models (D11, B21, B1, D110, B18).
* **Dual Interface Options:** Provides both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) to suit different user preferences.
* **Custom Label Design:** The GUI app enables users to design labels tailored to specific devices and label sizes.
* **Advanced Print Settings:** Customize print density, quantity, and image rotation for precise label printing.
